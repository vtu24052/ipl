                          <h2>PREVIEW: Q2 GT VS CSK</h2><b>
Ravindra Jadeja provided a grandstand finish, hitting a six and a four with 10 needed off the last two balls, to power Chennai Super Kings to their fifth IPL title as they beat defending champions Gujarat Titans by five wickets (DLS Method) in a thriller at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Jadeja smashed 15* off 6 balls as a collection of cameos from Devon Conway (47 off 25), Ruturaj Gaikwad (26 off 16), Shivam Dube (32* off 21). Ajinkya Rahane (27 off 13) and Ambati Rayudu (19 off 8) helped CSK chase down 171 from 15 overs in a rain-shortened IPL final.Earlier, Sai Sudharsan had put on a stunning show on the big stage with a splendid 96 off 47 balls, ably supported by Wriddhiman Saha (54 off 39) and Shubman Gill 39 (20) to help GT post a mammoth 214/4 before rain forced the match to be shortened to 15 overs.  Chasing 171 from 15 overs, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway got CSK off to a flier. Ruturaj got off the mark in style with a lovely square drive for a four off the third ball of the innings from Mohd. Shami. But soon after rain stopped play and the match was reduced to 15-overs with CSK having to chase a revised target of 171 runs. The revised playing conditions meant the Powerplay was reduced to four overs while a bowler could bowl a maximum of three overs.As play resumed, Gaikwad cracked another four in the unfinished first over as he pulled one through backward square leg to make it 10 runs off it. Devon Conway then got going straightaway as he lofted one over extra cover for a six off Hardik Pandya in the second over and then whipped one to fine leg for a four. He took the attack to Shami in the next over, smacking two more fours to accumulate 11 off it.Hardik Pandya introduced Rashid Khan early into the attack but the CSK batters went after him straightaway, cracking a couple of fours and a six to take CSK to 52/0 at the end of the Powerplay (4th over).Noor Ahmad bowled a good first over, giving away just six but Josh Little's first over went for 14 as Conway thumped a pull over deep mid-wicket off the last ball of the sixth over.The impressive Noor got the much-needed breakthrough for GT as he broke the 74-run opening stand by sending back Gaikwad (26 off 16) via a wrong'un. CSK then sent out Shivam Dube as their Impact Player, at No.3, replacing Matheesha Pathirana. Noor struck again off the final ball of the over to have Conway (47 off 25) caught at long off to peg CSK back.Ajinkya Rahane arrived and got going in style with two exquisite sixes off Josh Little to make it a 16-run over. Noor Ahmad though balanced things out with another brilliant over, giving away just five as he finished with impressive figures of 3-0-17-2.Rahane got the momentum back again with a couple of fours off Rashid to bring the equation down to 60 needed off 30. 
 
Mohit Sharma arrived into the attack in the 11th over and struck straightaway to get the crucial wicket of Rahane (27 off 13), caught a deep point off a slower one. The GT pacer bowled a fantastic over and gave away just six as the equation came to 53 needed off 24 balls. 
 
Rashid bowled four good balls, giving away just three in the 12th over but Dube finally found the middle of the bat as he thumped two sixes in a row to end the over on a high and amass 15 runs. Rayudu, playing his last IPL match, joined the party as he smacked the first ball of the 13th over from Mohit over long off for a six and then cracked a four off the next ball through extra cover, then thumped another six but Mohit hit back hard to have him caught and bowled off the next ball and then got the huge wicket of MS Dhoni off he next ball as he had him caught at extra cover. The roller-coaster saw 17 runs scored and two wickets taken as the equation came down to 21 needed off 12.Shami bowled a very good penultimate over to give away just eight. With 13 needed off the last over, the experienced Mohit nailed four yorkers upfront and gave away just three runs. With 10 needed off two, the tables turned again as Mohit missed his marker and Jadeja smacked a six over long on. With four needed off the last ball, Mohit bowled a low full toss down the leg side and Jadeja swiped it to fine leg for a four to win it for CSK and spark wild celebrations.

                                      <h2>MATCH REPORT:GT VS MI</h2><b>
                                        smissed Vinod in the same over before Rashid came back to trap Tim David LBW in the next over to reduce MI to 158/7. Mohit was unstoppable as he had Jordan and Piyush Chawla back in the hut in his next over and then picked up his fifth by having Kumar Kartikeya caught at long on to bowl MI out for 171. Mohit finished with sensational figures of 5/10, his best in IPL, as GT cruised to a 62-run win.Earlier, Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bowl. They made one change to the starting XI as Kumar Kartikeya replaced Hrithik Shokeen. They named Ramandeep Singh, Nehal Wadhera, Vishnu Vinod, Raghav Goyal and Sandeep Warrier as their substitutes.Gujarat Titans made two changes to the starting eleven as B Sai Sudharsan and Vijay Shankar replaced Dasun Shanaka and Darshan Nalkande. Josh Little, KS Bharat, Odean Smith, Sai Kishore and Shivam Mavi made it to Gujarat Titans' substitutes list.Gujarat Titans got off to a brisk start courtesy openers Wriddhiman Saha and Shubman Gill as the pair added 53 runs for the opening wicket. After a tight first over which saw Jason Behrendorff concede just three, Shubman Gill opened his boundary account as he flicked one wide of short fine leg a four off Green. Saha hit his first boundary in the next over as he lofted one over mid on off Behrendorff.
 
                                        Madhwal then pinged Saha's helmet with a lethal bouncer as he missed his pull but Saha gave him a fantastic reply as he cracked one over point for a powerful four.Gill continued to place them well as he clipped one wide of short fine leg for a four off Behrendorff and then Saha swiped one over square leg to end the over with a four and make it 11 off it.Gill welcomed Chris Jordan into the attack in style with a six and a four off the first two balls. Jordan nearly made a perfect comeback as Gill hit one uppishly to mid on but Tim David couldn't hold on to a tough chance as GT reached 50/0 at the end of the Powerplay.Rohit then brought Piyush Chawla into the attack and as he has done throughout the season, the wily spinner struck in the first over as he outfoxed Saha with a clever delivery. He saw Saha dance down the track and darted in a quicker one down the leg side. Saha missed it and Kishan made no mistake. The two overs after Powerplay brought 14 runs and a wicket.Gill and Sai Sudharsan brought back the momentum as the latter cracked a four off Chawla before Gill lofted one over the sightscreen to make it 16 off the over. Gill brought up yet another fifty, off 32 balls and then smacked an 89m six over deep square leg in the same over off Kartikeya to take GT to 91/1. The GT opener got a bit lucky in the next over as he smashed one back to Green who couldn't hold on to a really tough catch. Gill then went absolutely berserk and smashed three sixes off Madhwal before taking on Chawla and hammering two sixes and a four to amass 20 runs off the over.Sai Sudharsan joined the six-hitting party as he lofted one over long off for a six. Gill then brought up his third hundred of the season off just 49 balls in the 15th over, from Green. He followed it up with two sixes and a four off Green which included a tennis-forehadesque smash over deep mid-wicket as they accumulated 19 off the over.

                                       <h2>MATCH REPORT: M48 - GT VS CSK</h2><b>
                                        The ever so consistent Chennai Super Kings cruised into the final oF TATA IPL 2023 as they beat Gujarat Titans by 15 runs in Qualifier 1 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.

                                        Ruturaj Gaikwad starred with the bat as he hit a flamboyant 60(44) to lay the platform. Ambati Rayudu (17 off 9) and Ravindra Jadeja (22 off 16) then played brisk knocks to provide crucial late flourish and take CSK to a competitive 172/7. Ravindra Jadeja (2/18) and Maheesh Theekshana (2/28) then spun a web around the GT batters with spin, pace and bounce as a collective bowling effort saw CSK bowl GT out for 157 and cruise into their 10th IPL final.
                                        
                                        Chasing 173, Gujarat Titans got off to a mixed start as they lost Wriddhiman Saha inside the Powerplay and would have had Shubman Gill back in the hut too but Deepak Chahar couldn't hold on to a tough catch at mid on. In between the opening pair cracked a couple of fours and a six. Hardik Pandya got going with a brilliant drive on the up through cover-point for a four and Gill hit another marvellous flick for the second four in the next over from Tushar Deshpande as the pair took 10 off it. Dhoni then introduced Maheesh Theekshana in the sixth over and he struck to have GT captain Pandya caught at backward point. GT reached 41/2 at the end of the Powerplay.
                                        
                                        GT sent Dasun Shanaka up the order at No.4. The Sri Lankan all-rounder got together with Gill and stabilised the innings. Gill hit an odd four an over while Shanaka then upped the ante going after Theekshana, hitting him for a four and a six to take GT to 72/2 at the halfway mark.
                                        
                                        Shanaka though couldn't continue for long as he mistimed his reverse sweep to short third man off Jadeja in the next over. GT kept losing wickets at regular intervals as two overs later Jadeja struck a crucial blow as he cleaned up David Miller. But the big moment arrived in the next over as Dhoni brought back Chahar and he had the set Gill (42 off 38) caught at deep square leg off a slower short ball. GT got derailed in the 11 to 14 over phase with the loss of three wickets.
                                        
                                        The wickets continued to fall as Theekshana cleaned up Rahul Tewatia in the next over as GT were reduced to 98/6 in the 15th over. With 71 needed off 30 and the required rate above 14, Rashid Khan provided some relief, hitting a six and a four off Pathirana to take 13 off the over. Shankar and Rashid cracked two sixes and a four off Deshpande in the next over to take 19 off it as the equation came to 39 needed off 18.
                                        
                                        A couple of moments of brilliance saw the match turn again as Ruturaj pulled off a stupendous diving catch at deep mid-wicket off Pathirana to send back Shankar (14 off 10) and then substitute fielder Subhranshu Senapati ran out Darshan Nalkande via a brilliant direct hit off the next ball. Pathirana bowled a splendid 18th over, conceding just 4 runs. With 35 needed off 12, Rashid Khan(30 off 16) cracked a four off Deshpande but two balls later he hit a low full toss straight to deep point. Deshpande bowled a good over and gave away just eight including the crucial wicket of Rashid.
                                        
                                        With 27 needed off the last over, Gujarat Titans could manage just 11 runs as Pathirana picked up the final wicket of Shami to spark wild celebrations in the stands as CSK marched into their 10th IPL final, more than any other team in the competition.  
                                        
                                        Earlier, Gujarat Titans captain Hardik Pandya won the toss and elected to bowl. They made one change to the starting XI as Darshan Nalkande replaced Yash Dayal.
                                        
                                        Chennai Super Kings, on the other hand, named an unchanged eleven. They named Matheesha Pathirana, Mitchell Santner, Subhranshu Senapatim Shaik Rasheed and Akash Singh as their substitutes.
                                        
                                        Qualifier 1 got off to an eventful start as Darshan Nalkande had Ruturaj Gaikwad caught at short mid-wicket but a few seconds later the ground siren rang signalling a NO BALL as Nalkande had overstepped. Ruturaj made Nalkande pay for the error as he cracked the next one over long on for a six and then cracked one through covers for four. A couple more wide of third man made it 14 runs off the over.
                                        
                                        That Nalkande over was sandwiched between two very good overs from Shami who bowled with discipline and accuracy along with a bit of a swing to make it just 8 runs from his two overs. Nalkande came back well and gave away 8 runs in the next over. He had conceded just four off the first five balls but Conway pierced the gap through the off side to hit a four through point off the last ball. Ruturaj and Conway didn't let the spinners settle in as Gaikwad lofted one over extra cover off Rashid Khan for a four and the duo took 9 off it and then they hit a couple of fours off Noor Ahmad to take another 9 off the over as CSK reached 49/0 at the end of the Powerplay.
                                        
                                        The duo brought up another 50-run stand, off 38 balls, their ninth 50+ stand in the tournament so far. Ruturaj then brought up his fifty, off 36 balls, as he carved one over point for a four. He followed it up with a streaky four off an inside edge to fine leg three balls later as they accumulated 12 off it. Conway sliced one over backward point for a four off Noor Ahmad as CSK reached 85/0 at the halfway stage.
                                        
                                        Mohit finally broke the opening stand as he had Ruturaj (60 off 44) caught at long on off a mistimed heave. GT got two in quick succession as Noor got the important wicket of Dube(1 off 3). Dube went for a powerful swing but was beaten by the wrong'un and found the stumps knocked down. GT choked the scoring and then Conway received a reprieve as Saha couldn't hold on to a tough catch behind the stumps off Rashid.
                                        
                                        Conway and Rahane then took the attack to Nalkande, Conway got a fortuitous four off an outside edge which flew wide of the keeper and Rahane flicked one for a six over deep square leg. Nalkande however bounced back to have Rahane (17 off 10) caught at point off the next ball.
                                        
                                        Rayudu arrived, charged and smashed the first ball over extra cover for a four. However, CSK lost Conway (40 off 34) off the very next ball as Shami came back and had the New Zealand batter caught at deep mid-wicket. The boundaries dried down again as the 16th and 17th over went boundaryless with just 12 runs scored. Rayudu finally broke the drought, after 16 balls as he smacked one over deep mid-wicket off Rashid Khan. But the Afghanistan star hit back hard to send back Rayudu (17 off 9) next ball as he miscued one to deep mid-wicket.
                                        
                                        Jadeja lofted one over extra cover off Mohit for a four in the penultimate over but Mohit struck two balls later to have the CSK captain caught at extra cover off a slower ball, much to the disappointment of the Chepauk crowd.
                                        
                                        Jadeja and Moeen then provided the late flourish as they hit a four and a six to take 15 off the last over before Jadeja (22 off 16) was cleaned up off the last ball of the over as CSK posted
                                        
                                        GT introduced Vijay Shankar as their Impact Player, replacing Mohit Sharma, at the start of the second innings while CSK introduced Matheesha Pathirana as their Impact Player in the first over of the second innings.

<h2>MOHITH SHARMA</h2><b>
    Mohit Sharma, a right-arm medium-fast bowler who plays for Haryana came into limelight in the 2012/2013 Ranji season after he finished as the fifth highest wicket-taker. Working diligently with Ian Pont, the world-renowned bowling coach, Sharma bagged 37 wickets in just 8 games in that season.

    His consistent run in the domestic circuit impressed the Chennai Super Kings as they signed him for the 2013 edition of the IPL. Chennai bowling coach Andy Bichel shortlisted him after a one-day bowling camp in January.
    
    Soon he got a maiden call-up to the national side for the Zimbabwe ODI series in July 2013. It was a dream debut as he was adjudged the Man of the Match in his first game for economical figures of 2/26 in 10 overs. Mohit was later named in the ODI squads for the home series against West Indies and the tour South Africa.
    
    He was back in the domestic circuit when not on national tour before the 2014 World T20 in Bangladesh. He made his T20I debut against Australia and also featured in the semi-final and the final of the tournament.
    
    In the 2014 IPL auctions, Chennai bought him back for 2 crores after being released into the auctions pool.
    
    Mohit Sharma received a lucky call-up to the 2015 World Cup squad after Ishant Sharma was ruled out of the tournament due to injury. He impressed everyone with his disciplined bowling skills. He picked up 13 scalps in the tournament and supported Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav admirably. He played a few more games till the end of the year, but was not recalled again for national duty.
    
    IPL through the years
    
    Sharma was a hit in his debut IPL season (2013) picking up 20 wickets in 15 matches and finished as their second best bowler in that season. He set the IPL on fire as an useful new ball bowler providing early breakthroughs. His smooth delivery stride and ability to bowl a tight line and length impressed everyone. He was one of the top Powerplay bowlers in the tournament.
