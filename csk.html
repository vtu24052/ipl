                                      <h2> MATCH REPORT: M50 - CSK VS KKR</h2><b>

										Kolkata Knight Riders bagged two important points as they bounced back from the defeat against Rajasthan Royals to beat Chennai Super Kings in Match 61 of TATA IPL 2023 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.

										A skillful and disciplined bowling performance from the KKR bowlers, led by Sunil Narine (2/15), saw the away team restrict CSK to 144/6. Captain Nitish Rana (57* off 44) and the in-form Rinku Singh (54 off 43) then stabilised a stuttering chase with composed knocks and mixed caution with aggression to take KKR past the finish line with some impressive and sensible batting.
										 
										Chasing 145, KKR got off to a stuttering start as they lost Rahmanullah Gurbaz in the first over was a sliced one wide of third man where Tushar Deshpande pouched a very good balancing catch.
										
										Impact Player Venkatesh Iyer then tried to provide some impetus with two fours off Chahar. But the CSK pacer bounced back to have Iyer caught at slip in the same over. Nitish Rana opened his boundary account with a six over long leg off Chahar but Chahar hit back again in the same over as he had Jason Roy caught at slip off a knuckle ball. Captain Nitish Rana looked in good touch as he lofted another six over long off, off Deshpande to take KKR to 46/3 at the end of the Powerplay.
										
										CSK bowled with discipline and gave away just 21 off the next four overs as the away team reached 67/3 at the halfway mark but run rate was the least of concerns for KKR. They required stability and rebuilding and Rana and Rinku were doing a really good job of it. CSK came close to picking a wicket as Rana top edged his sweep to deep square leg where Pathirana couldn't hold on to a tough chance. Rana and Rinku kept chipping away without taking many risks and then brought up the 50-run stand in the 12th over. The duo then upped the ante as Rana hit back to back fours off Moeen Ali. Rinku Singh then smacked a six off Jadeja before Rana took on Theekshana for a couple of fours to bring the required run rate below six with 28 needed off 30. Rinku Singh then brought up his fifty off 39 balls with a four off Pathirana as KKR took 9 runs from the over.
										
										Rana brought up his 50 off 38 balls as the duo took six singles off Theekshana in the 17th over. The 99-run stand was finally broken via a brilliant direct hit run out from Moeen Ali to send back Rinku Singh (54 off 43). Rana (57* off 44) and Russell made sure there were no more stutters as they finished off the chase with nine balls to spare.
										
										Earlier, Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni won the toss and elected to bat. They named an unchanged XI. Matheesha Pathirana, Nishant Sindhu, Subhranshu Senapati, Shaik Rasheed and Akash Singh made it to the home team's substitutes list.
										
										Kolkata Knight Riders made two changes to the starting eleven as Vaibhav Arora and Suyash Sharma replaced Venkatesh Iyer and Anukul Roy. They named N Jagadeesan, Umesh Yadav, Venkatesh Iyer, Lockie Ferguson and Anukul Roy as their substitutes.

                                     <h2>FINAL MATCH : CSK VS GT</h2><b>

Ravindra Jadeja provided a grandstand finish, hitting a six and a four with 10 needed off the last two balls, to power Chennai Super Kings to their fifth IPL title as they beat defending champions Gujarat Titans by five wickets (DLS Method) in a thriller at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Jadeja smashed 15* off 6 balls as a collection of cameos from Devon Conway (47 off 25), Ruturaj Gaikwad (26 off 16), Shivam Dube (32* off 21). Ajinkya Rahane (27 off 13) and Ambati Rayudu (19 off 8) helped CSK chase down 171 from 15 overs in a rain-shortened IPL final.Earlier, Sai Sudharsan had put on a stunning show on the big stage with a splendid 96 off 47 balls, ably supported by Wriddhiman Saha (54 off 39) and Shubman Gill 39 (20) to help GT post a mammoth 214/4 before rain forced the match to be shortened to 15 overs.  Chasing 171 from 15 overs, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway got CSK off to a flier. Ruturaj got off the mark in style with a lovely square drive for a four off the third ball of the innings from Mohd. Shami. But soon after rain stopped play and the match was reduced to 15-overs with CSK having to chase a revised target of 171 runs. The revised playing conditions meant the Powerplay was reduced to four overs while a bowler could bowl a maximum of three overs.As play resumed, Gaikwad cracked another four in the unfinished first over as he pulled one through backward square leg to make it 10 runs off it. Devon Conway then got going straightaway as he lofted one over extra cover for a six off Hardik Pandya in the second over and then whipped one to fine leg for a four. He took the attack to Shami in the next over, smacking two more fours to accumulate 11 off it.Hardik Pandya introduced Rashid Khan early into the attack but the CSK batters went after him straightaway, cracking a couple of fours and a six to take CSK to 52/0 at the end of the Powerplay (4th over).Noor Ahmad bowled a good first over, giving away just six but Josh Little's first over went for 14 as Conway thumped a pull over deep mid-wicket off the last ball of the sixth over.The impressive Noor got the much-needed breakthrough for GT as he broke the 74-run opening stand by sending back Gaikwad (26 off 16) via a wrong'un. CSK then sent out Shivam Dube as their Impact Player, at No.3, replacing Matheesha Pathirana. Noor struck again off the final ball of the over to have Conway (47 off 25) caught at long off to peg CSK back.Ajinkya Rahane arrived and got going in style with two exquisite sixes off Josh Little to make it a 16-run over. Noor Ahmad though balanced things out with another brilliant over, giving away just five as he finished with impressive figures of 3-0-17-2.Rahane got the momentum back again with a couple of fours off Rashid to bring the equation down to 60 needed off 30. 
 
Mohit Sharma arrived into the attack in the 11th over and struck straightaway to get the crucial wicket of Rahane (27 off 13), caught a deep point off a slower one. The GT pacer bowled a fantastic over and gave away just six as the equation came to 53 needed off 24 balls. 
 
Rashid bowled four good balls, giving away just three in the 12th over but Dube finally found the middle of the bat as he thumped two sixes in a row to end the over on a high and amass 15 runs. Rayudu, playing his last IPL match, joined the party as he smacked the first ball of the 13th over from Mohit over long off for a six and then cracked a four off the next ball through extra cover, then thumped another six but Mohit hit back hard to have him caught and bowled off the next ball and then got the huge wicket of MS Dhoni off he next ball as he had him caught at extra cover. The roller-coaster saw 17 runs scored and two wickets taken as the equation came down to 21 needed off 12.
