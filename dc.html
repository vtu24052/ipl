                          <h2>PREVIEW: PBKS VS DC</h2><b>
Delhi Capitals dealt a hammer blow to Punjab Kings' chances of qualifying for the Play-offs as they beat the hosts by 15 runs in Match 64 of TATA IPL 2023 at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala.

A commanding batting performance led by Rilee Rossouw (82* off 37) helped the away side post a daunting 213/2 after the openers David Warner (46 off 31) and comeback man Prithvi Shaw (54 off 38) had added 94 for the opening wicket. A collective bowling effort then saw the DC bowlers survive Livingstone(94 off 48) scare as they restricted PBKS to 198/8 and won the match by 15 runs.

Chasing 214, Punjab Kings stuttered at the start as they lost captain Shikhar Dhawan early. Khaleel Ahmed bowled a fantastic first over for a maiden and then Ishan Sharma struck with his first ball, having Dhawan caught at slip in the second over. Prabhsimran Singh then took the aggressive route as he combined power with placement to hit four fours, including three back to back fours off Ishant Sharma. Atharva Taide took the attack to Anich Nortje in the next over, cracking a four and a six and then hitting a four and a six off Mukesh Kumar but PBKS got lucky off the last ball of the over as the keeper missed a run out with Prabhsimran set off for a bye but was sent back by Taide. A direct hit would have been curtains for the PBKS opener. The home side reached 47/1 at the end of the Powerplay.

Axar Patel came into the attack and struck straightaway to provide the breakthrough as he had Prabhsimran (22 off 19) caught at wide long on. DC could have had a couple more but Nortje dropped Liam Livingstone and Yash Dhull dropped Atharva Taide in one Kuldeep Yadav over. Livingstone rubbed salt into the wounds cracking a huge six off the penultimate ball of the over as PBKS reached 75/2 at the halfway stage. Luck continued to favour PBKS as Livingstone and Taide survived run outs off the same ball trying to run through for a risky single and then an overthrow. Taide and Livingstone were living dangerously as a couple of mistimed shots fell short of the fieders. The duo hit 15 runs off Axar and 12 runs off Nortje as Taide brought up his fifty off 38 balls. Kuldeep then bowled a tight over, conceding just five off the over.

                                      <h2>PREVIEW:  DC VS SRH</h2><b>
										That's a convincing win for DC. They move fifth in the points table. SRH are sixth. DC win by 21 runs. An all-round show by DC. Warner and Powell's pyrotechnics powered DC to a formidable total before the SRH bowlers kept chipping away at SRH, not letting the game get out of their hand at any stage. Nicholas Pooran and Aiden Markram mounted a fightback but it wasn't enough in the end. That would be all from our side. Thanks.

										27 needed off 6 balls. Kuldeep Yadav clean bowls Tyagi first ball. Bhuvi is the new man in. Bhuvi smacks the third ball for four. 1 off the fourth. Dot ball. Another dot ball.
										Gopal hits the first ball for four. Marsh is bowling out. Make that two fours in two. Tyagi hits the fourth ball for four. 16 from the over.

SRH 165/7 in 18 overs: Thakur. Pooran biffs the first ball for four. He is dropped off the third ball. They take two. Pooran hits the next ball for six. He is caught next ball. Has mishit a full toss. Umpires check for waist high no ball but bowler's fine. Pooran goes for 34-ball 62. Kartik Tyagi is in next. Sunrisers need 43 runs in 12 balls.

SRH 153/6 in 17 overs: Pooran reaches 50 off 29 balls with a single. Khaleel is bowling out. Abbott hits the third ball for six. He is caught next ball. Here's Shreyas Gopal. 7 off the over. Khaleel - 4-0-30-3.
n the last match between these two sides, Delhi Capitals beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 8 wickets at the Dubai International Stadium, Dubai, UAE.


When we think of Sunrisers Hyderabad’s campaign at the last  IPL,  two images could come to the mind. One warmed the heart; the other tugged it a bit. 

The sight of an unknown  Umran Malik  racing up to the wicket and releasing those thunderbolts excited not just the SRH fan, but everyone except those who would have to face him with a bat.

The other image was an SRH team without David Warner inside the stadium. The Aussie opener, who had been at Hyderabad since 2014 and led the franchise to its only title in 2016, was forced to watch his team’s matches in the latter part of the tournament from his hotel room.

Warner has since joined Delhi Capitals. On Thursday night at the Brabourne Stadium here, he will face some familiar faces as Sunrisers takes on Capitals, with both sides looking to bounce back after losing their last matches (to Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants respectively). With the battles for the playoff spots hotting up, SRH is on 10 points and DC eight.

                                       <h2>MATCH REPORT: M53 - DC VS GT</h2><b>
										the Narendra Modi Stadium witnessed its lowest total for a team batting first in Indian Premier League 2023. With the opposition lacking star appeal and having a mediocre season, it also resulted in the lowest turnout of the season at the largest cricket stadium in the world.

										But each one of the 43,471 spectators who attended the match got their penny’s worth. The Capitals’ bowling attack ensured that their team’s lower-order resurgence did not go waste as it defended 130. The five-run victory, with Ishant Sharma defending 12 runs in the last over, kept the Capitals campaign alive with its third win in nine games so far.
										
Thanks to overcast conditions, a pitch aiding pacers and Mohammed Shami’s sensational pace up front, the Narendra Modi Stadium witnessed its lowest total for a team batting first in Indian Premier League 2023. With the opposition lacking star appeal and having a mediocre season, it also resulted in the lowest turnout of the season at the largest cricket stadium in the world.

But each one of the 43,471 spectators who attended the match got their penny’s worth. The Capitals’ bowling attack ensured that their team’s lower-order resurgence did not go waste as it defended 130. The five-run victory, with Ishant Sharma defending 12 runs in the last over, kept the Capitals campaign alive with its third win in nine games so far.


When Ishant started the last over, the Titans’ looked well on course to end the game with a well-timed chase. Captain Hardik Pandya was at the crease in an innings that ended up being a sedate knock without a peak. More importantly, Rahul Tewatia was living up to his billing of Mr. Finisher, having registered a hat-trick of sixes off Anrich Nortje’s previous over to bring the equation down from 30 off nine balls to 12 off six.

But Ishant used all his experience and landed wide yorkers precisely to not concede a single boundary and dismiss Tewatia off the fourth ball. Ishant thus ensured that the night will be remembered as much for his last over as for Shami’s scintillating spell.

<h2>PREVIEW: M37 - DC VS CSK</h2><b>
	Chennai Super Kings beat Delhi Capitals by 27 runs to take a massive stride towards playoff qualification. Matheesha Pathirana was the top performer with the ball thanks to three dismissals for MS Dhoni's side while Deepak Chahar took two wickets. Earlier, MS Dhoni played an important 9-ball-20 cameo while Shivam Dube top-scored with 25 as Chennai Super Kings finished at 167/8 in 20 overs. Mitchell Marsh was the pick of the bowlers for Delhi Capitals with three wickets while Axar Patel took two. Dhoni won the toss and opted to bat against Delhi Capitals

	Deepak Chahar then shone with a ball with an excellent spell of 3/22 as a combined bowling effort saw CSK restrict DC to 146/9 despite a brave effort from David Warner who fought the lone battle with a brilliant knock of 86(58).

Warner then broke the shackles, hammering a six and a four over long on off Deepak Chahar in the fifth over but the CSK pacer hit back hard as he send back Phil Salt, caught at extra cover and then made Rilee Rossouw drag one onto his stumps off the next ball to script a splendid comeback. Warner ended the Powerplay with a six as DC trudged to 34/3.
