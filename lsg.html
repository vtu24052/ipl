                          <h2>PREVIEW: LSG VS MI</h2><b>
                            Akash Madhwal's sizzling maiden five-wicket haul (5/5), a collection of impactful batting cameos coupled with an electric fielding performance helped Mumbai Indians beat Lucknow Super Giants by 81 runs in the Eliminator and cruise into Qualifier 2 of the TATA IPL 2023.

                            Impactful attacking cameos from Cameron Green (41 off 23), Suryakumar Yadav (33 off 20), Tilak Varma (26 off 22) and Impact Player Nehal Wadhera (23 off 12) propelled Mumbai Indians to a competitive 182/8. Akash Madhwal then took the centrestage on the big stage with a lethal spell of 5/5 to rip through LSG's batting order as the Krunal Pandya-led side succumbed under pressure to get bowled out for 101 which included three run-outs.
                            
                            Chasing 183, LSG got off to a stuttering start as they lost Prerak Mankad early. They would have had Kyle Mayers back in the hut too but he got lucky in the first over as he survived a run out chance. Prerak Mankad hit one to point where Shokeen made a stunning one-handed stop and missed his direct hit at the non-striker's end as Mayers went back after being stranded mid-way due to a mix-up. He would have been well short had the fielder hit the stumps. Akash Madhwal then struck two balls later as Mankad mistimed his slash to third man where Shokeen was in action again and he made no mistake with the catch. Mayers'(18 off 13) luck didn't last long as he mistimed his pull to mid on off Jordan in the fourth over.
                            
                            MI could have had the dangerous Marcus Stoinis back in the hut in the next over but Wadhera misjudged a catch at deep point and fell short after putting in a dive charging forward. Stoinis then went after Shokeen, hitting a couple of well=place fours and a straight lofted six to amass 18 off the over and take LSG to 54/2 at the end of the Powerplay.
                            
                            Just when a partnership was developing, the experienced Piyush Chawla struck to break the 46-run stand as he had captain Krunal Pandya(8 off 11) caught at long on. The pressure was building and Ayush Badoni succumbed to it as he went for a swing across the line off Madhwal but missed it and found the off stump knocked down. Madhwal bowled a beauty next ball to have the dangerous Nicholas Pooran caught behind as MI reduced LSG to 75/5 at the halfway mark.
                            
                            It was all going downhill as Stoinis was run out after a clash mid-way with Hooda while looking to go for a tight second. A brilliant tag-team effort from Green and Rohit saw Gowtham run out as Rohit scored a direct hit from covers. Gowtham tapped it to point where Green made a diving stop and relayed it to Rohit, Gowtham saw an opportunity for a single and set off but was sent back, he was late as Rohit scored a direct hit and he was found well short.
                            
                            Akash Madhwal then came back and had Ravi Bishnoi caught at long on. The calamity continued as another massive mix up saw Deepak Hooda walk back to the hut in the same over as LSG crumbled to 100/9. Madhwal then fittingly finished the game off as he cleaned up Mohsin Khan with a cracking yorker to register his maiden five-wicket haul in the IPL and finish with the best figures in IPL 2023 so far with 3.5-0-5-5.
                            
                            Earlier, Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bat. They made two changes to the starting XI as Tilak Varma and Hrithik Shokeen replaced Nehal Wadhera and Kumar Kartikeya. They named Ramandeep Singh, Nehal Wadhera, Vishnu Vinod, Kumar Kartikeya, Sandeep Warrier as their substitutes.
                            
                            Lucknow Super Giants also made two changes to the starting eleven as Deepak Hooda and Yash Thakur replaced Quinton de Kock and Karan Sharma. Kyle Mayers, Daniel Sams, Yudhvir Singh, Swapnil Singh and Amit Mishra made it to their substitutes list.

                                       <h2>MATCH REPORT: M53 - LSG VS GT</h2><b>
										Table toppers Gujarat Titans registered their eighth win from eleven matches to extend their lead at the top as they beat Lucknow Super Giants in Match 51 of TATA IPL 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

A fascinating opening act which saw Wriddhiman Saha smash a scintillating 81(43) and Shubman Gill hit an effortless 94*(51) powered the home side to a gigantic total of 227/2. Mohit Sharma then led the way with the ball with a fantastic spell of 4-0-29-4 as a collective bowling effort saw GT survive Kyle Mayers (48 off 32), Quinton de Kock (71 off 42) blitzes to win the match by 56 runs.

It was a proud and emotional day for the Pandya household as Krunal and Hardik Pandya became the first pair of brothers to lead their respective teams in the IPL.

Chasing 228, Kyle Mayers was off the blocks early as he cracked three consecutive fours off Hardik Pandya in the second over after Mohd. Shami had bowled an impressive first over, giving just 4 runs. De Kock joined the party, hitting a couple of fours off Shami in the third over before Mayers hammered one over mid-wicket for a six and crunched the last ball through covers for a four to make it 19 off the over.

An eventful over followed as De Kock hit a couple of fours to start the Hardik over but Rashid Khan dropped Mayers at point three balls later. Mayers ended the over with a four to bring up the 50 in the 4th over. The pair took the attack to the spinners - Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad - and accumulated 22 runs off two overs to take the score to 72/0 at the end of the Powerplay.

It took a moment of brilliance to break the 88-run opening partnership as Rashid Khan pulled off a magnificent running catch, where he ran 26m to pull off a diving catch, to dismiss Kyle Mayers 48(32), off Mohit Sharma. De Kock released some pressure as he whipped a flat six over deep square leg off Hardik to take LSG to 102/1 at the halfway mark.

Mohit and Rashid slowed things down as De Kock brought up his fifty off 31 balls. Hardik then brought back Shami and he struck immediately, having Deepak Hooda (11 off 11) caught at deep mid-wicket. De Kock finally broke the boundary drought, which lasted for over four overs, in the 15th over as he smacked one over long off, off Mohit. The GT pacer though bounced back to remove Stoinis (4 off 9) in the same over as he had him caught at short third man off a slower one. With the required run rate climbing over 21, De Kock looked to up the ante but departed in doing so as he missed his swing across the line and was cleaned up by Rashid Khan. Noor Ahmed then had Nicholas Pooran caught at short third man as things kept going further away for LSG. Ayush Badoni hit some crucial runs (21 off 11) which would help their net run rate a bit but overall, they fell well short of their target, finishing on 171/7. Mohit Sharma removed Badoni and Krunal Pandya off consecutive balls to finish with superb figures of 4-0-29-4.

Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants captain Krunal Pandya won the toss and elected to bowl. They made five changes to the starting eleven as Quinton de Kock, Deepak Hooda, Swapnil Singh, Avesh Khan and Yash Thakur replaced Naveen-ul-Haq, Manan Vohra, Ayush Badoni, Karan Sharma and K Gowtham. The away side named Ayush Badoni, Daniel Sams, Amit Mishra, Prerak Mankad and Yudhvir Singh Charak as their substitutes.  

Gujarat Titans made one change to the starting eleven as Shubman Gill replaced Josh Little (Left for National duties). Alzarri Joseph, Dasun Shanaka, KS Bharat, Shivam Mavi and Jayant Yadav made it to the home side's substitutes list.

GT opener Wriddhiman Saha got his team off to a flier as he went on the attack early to rattle the LSG bowlers. He started a bit tentatively with an edged four to third man off Mohsin Khan but he hit a beautiful extra cover drive off the next ball to make it 12 runs from the first over. The GT wicket-keeper batter opened the maximum account by pulling one over fine leg off Avesh Khan in the next over. He then charged down the track to pull one behind backward square leg for a four to make it 11 off the over. Krunal Pandya brought himself on to bowl early in the third over and bowled a decent over, conceding just one four, as Saha lofted one over extra cover. Saha again picked up the pace in the next over, smacking a four over deep square leg and then whipping one behind square leg for a four off Mohsin. He lofted the next one over extra cover for an effortless six and then pulled another one through mid-wicket for a four to make it 22 off the over and bring up GT's fifty in just the fourth over.
