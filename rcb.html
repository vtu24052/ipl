                          <h2>MATCH REPORT: RCB VS RR</h2><b>
							The Rajasthan Royals (RR) marched to the finals of the TATA Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 with a comprehensive 7-wicket win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on Friday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.A spectacular batting display by Jos Buttler, who slammed his fourth century of the season, powered RR to a clinical 7-wicket win and sealed their spot for the final.Chasing 158 to win, RR were off to a flier after Yashasvi Jaiswal whacked two sixes and a four in the first over. Jos Buttler at the other end took Siraj to the cleaners and punched two fours and a massive six. RR added 19 off the fifth over after Buttler attacked Shahbaz Ahmed’s spin in the 5th over. Josh Hazlewood provided the opening wicket for RCB after Jaiswal was caught at point but RR were going strong with 67/1 at the end of the powerplay. Buttler creamed a four to reach his fifty and was joined by skipper Sanju Samson. The duo continued the easy flow of runs and RR were comfortably placed at the halfway stage at 103/1 after 10 overs. The fifty partnership was up for the second wicket before the RR skipper was out stumped against Hasaranga. The equation was down to run-a-ball for RR as Devdutt Padikkal joined the well-set Buttler at the crease. After a couple of quiet overs, Buttler clubbed two sixes against Hasaranga to bring the equation down to 18 off 24. While the RR opener moved into the nineties, Hazlewood scalped his second wicket to dismiss Padikkal, who was caught behind in the 17th over. Buttler reached his fourth century of the season and finished the game in style with a maximum as RR successfully chased down the target with 11 balls to spare.

                                      <h2>MATCH REPORT: RCB VS MI</h2><b>
										Suryakumar storm hit Royal Challengers Bangalore as the MI batter scored a match-winning 83(35) to chase down 200 in Match 54 of TATA IPL 2023 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

										Suryakumar Yadav put on a show at the Wankhede Stadium as he hammered seven fours and six sixes on his way to 83 off 35 balls to power MI to a six-wicket win after Faf du Plessis (65 off 41) and Glenn Maxwell (68 off 33) fifties had propelled RCB to a competitive 199/6.
										
										Jason Behrendorff was the pick of the bowlers for Mumbai Indians with figures of 4-0-36-3.
										
										Chasing 200, MI got off to a brisk start as the openers - Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan went on the attack early. The duo hit three fours off Josh Hazlewood in the second over. Kishan then took the attack to Siraj, hitting two consecutive sixes.
										
										Kishan welcomed Hasaranga into the attack with a four and a six but the Sri Lankan all-rounder hit back hard to have Kishan (42 off 21) caught behind and then trap Rohit Sharma (7 off 8) LBW via a successful review. Nehal Wadhera and Suryakumar Yadav then mixed caution with aggression, hitting an odd four every over to take the score to 99/2 at the halfway mark.
										
										The pair then hit fifth gear straight as they hit a six each off Hasaranga. They took 10 runs off Hazlewood and hammered 17 runs off Harshal to bring the equation down to 59 needed off 42 balls. Suryakumar Yadav brought up his fifty off just 25 balls as he cracked a four and a straight six off Siraj.
										
										Suryakumar then went berserk smashing two sixes off Hasaranga and two sixes and a four off Vijaykumar Vyshak but the RCB pacer bounced back to have Suryakumar caught at deep square leg and then sent back David off the next ball as the roller-coaster 19-run over came to an end with 7 needed off 24 balls. Wadhera then finished off the match in style by cracking a six over cover off Green as MI won by six wickets with 21 balls to spare. Wadhera remained unbeaten on 52 off 34 balls.
										
										Earlier, Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bowl. They made three changes to the starting XI as debutant Chris Jordan, Jason Behrendorff and Kumar Kartikeya replaced Jofra Archer, Tristan Stubbs and Arshad Khan. They named Ramandeep Singh, Tristan Stubbs, Vishnu Vinod, Sandeep Warrier and Raghav Goel as their substitutes.
										
										Royal Challengers Bangalore made two changes to the starting eleven as Vijay Kumar Vyshak and Harshal Patel replaced Karn Sharma and Kedar Jadhav. Michael Bracewell, Suyash Prabhudessai, Kedar Jadhav, Karn Sharma and Shahbaz Ahmed made it to their substitutes list.
										
										The match got off to a dramatic start as Faf du Plessis got a reprieve off the fourth ball of the over, dropped at mid-wicket by Nehal Wadhera, off Jason Behrendorff. The MI pacer struck next ball to get the big wicket of Kohli who charged down the track to heave it across the line but ended up edging it to the keeper. The umpire didn't give it out on the appeal but Rohit immediately reviewed it and replays showed there was a big edge.
										
										Faf du Plessis then got into the groove as he cracked back to back fours off Piyush Chawla to make it 9 runs off the second over.
										
										Anuj Rawat opened his boundary account smashing one over covers off Behrendorff. But the MI pacer bounced back to get the RCB Southpaw who shuffled across and looked to scoop but got a top edge and Cameron Green pouched a good tricky catch running backward from slip. Du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell then got together and counter-attacked. Maxwell got off the mark with a crunching four through cover-point, off Behrendorff. The RCB captain smacked a couple of fours off Green before the duo took the attack to Behrendorff again, smashing a couple of fours and a six to make it a 16-run over. The attack continued as Maxwell unfurled a reverse sweep and a beautiful cover drive for consecutive fours to take RCB to 56/2 at the end of the Powerplay.
										
										Maxwell then welcomed Chris Jordan into the attack with a couple of thumping sixes over the leg side to bring up the 50-run stand off just 26 balls. Maxwell then brought up his fifty off just 25 balls as the duo hit a four and a six off Akash Madhwal to accumulate 17 runs off the over and take RCB to 104/2. Du Plessis then brought up his half-century off 30 balls in an over where Maxwell hit a mind-boggling reverse scoop six over third man off Jordan.

                                       <h2>RCB VS CSK</h2><b>
										Royal Challengers Bangalore got back to winning ways, after the defeat against Chennai Super Kings, to beat Punjab Kings in Match 27 of TATA IPL 2023 at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali.

										Composed half-centuries from Virat Kohli (59 off 47) and Faf du Plessis (84 off 56) propelled RCB to a competitive 174/4. Mohd. Siraj then produced his career-best IPL figures (4/24) and pulled off a brilliant run out as RCB survived late fight from Jitesh Sharma (41 off 27) to bowl PBKS out for 150 and win the match by 24 runs.
										
										Chasing 175, PBKS got off to a stuttering start. They received an early blow as they lost opener Atharva Taide off the second ball of the innings. He started off with a four, flicking one off Siraj through square leg but missed the second inswinger and was hit on the pads. The umpire turned down the LBW appeal but RCB opted to review and replays showed it was hitting middle and leg - three reds. The decision was overturned and Taide had to walk back.
										
										Matthew Short showed early signs of aggression as he thumped a six and a four off Wayne Parnell in the second over. Kohli introduced spin early, in the third over, and the move worked as Wanindu Hasaranga cleaned up Short (8 off 7) who went for a swing across the line by charging down the track first ball but missed it completely.
										
										Kohli then brought back Siraj again and another of his bowling moves worked as the pacer trapped Liam Livingstone LBW. Livingstone came down the track and missed his swing across the line. The umpire turned down the appeal but Kohli went for the review and replays showed three reds again. It was another excellent review from RCB.
										
										Siraj was in action again as he pulled off a brilliant direct hit from mid off to run out Harpreet Singh. PBKS did hit a few fours and sixes but they had lost four wickets inside the Powerplay as they reached 49/4 at the end of six overs.
										
										Prabhsimran Singh, who held fort at one end and kept the scoreboard ticking, then released some pressure as he cracked a couple of sixes off Hasaranga. The Sri Lankan all-rounder though pulled off a brilliant direct-hit run out of Sam Curran in the next over via a powerful throw at the non-striker's end. PBKS reached 77/5 at the halfway mark. Jitesh Sharma came out and went on the attack straightaway hitting a four and a six off Harshal and in between, he was given out LBW but he reviewed it and replays showed it was missing leg.
										
										Prabhsimran hit his fourth six of the innings, swiping one over fine leg, off Parnell. But the RCB all-rounder gave a perfect reply next ball as he knocked down Prabhsimran's (46 off 30) off stump. Shahrukh Khan got off the mark with a huge six off Parnell but couldn't last long as he was stumped off a googly from Hasaraga in the next over.
										
										With 61 needed off 36, Jitesh Sharma went on the attack, hitting a six off Hasaranga and then a four and six off Vyshak to bring the equation down to 37 off 24. Jitesh received a lifeline in the next over as he mistimed one to long on where Kohli dropped a tough catch as two fielders converged and nearly collided to take the catch. Harshal bowled an excellent over and gave away just seven as the equation read 30 needed from 18 balls.
										
										Siraj then came back and knocked down the stumps of Harpreet Brar (13 off 13) and Nathan Ellis (1 off 2) to finish his best figures in IPL - 4-0-21-4. With 26 needed off 12, Harshal brought Jitesh Sharma's fighting innings of 41(27) to end as he had him caught at backward point off a slower one as RCB won the match by 24 runs.
										
										Earlier, Punjab Kings captain Sam Curran, who was still leading the side in absence of the injured Shikhar Dhawan who hadn't recovered, won the toss and elected to bowl. They made two changes to their starting XI as Liam Livingstone and Nathan Ellis replaced Sikandar Raza and Kagiso Rabada. They named Prabhsimran Singh, Sikandar Raza, Mohit Rathee, Rishi Dhawan and Shivam Singh as their substitutes.
										
										Virat Kohli was leading RCB given that Faf du Plessis potentially couldn’t field because of his rib injury. They made one change to their starting eleven as Suyash Prabhudessai replaced Vyshak. They named Vijaykumar Vyshak, David Willey, Akash Deep, Karn Sharma and Anuj Rawat as their substitutes.
										
										Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis got RCB off to a steady start. Kohli was the aggressor to start off as he hit three fours in the first three overs. Du Plesss then opened up as he cracked a couple of sixes off Harpreet Brar as the pair took 17 runs off the fourth over. The duo found gaps with ease with well-placed shots to hit three more fours and bring up another fifty-run stand as RCB reached 59/0 at the end of the Powerplay. Kohli and du Plessis played the short ball well and hit boundaries off it without taking too much of a risk.
										
										Things slowed down a bit after the powerplay and it was Faf du Plessis taking the aggressor's mantle hitting a six and a couple of fours in the 6-10 over phase and bringing up his fifty off 31 balls. RCB reached 91/0 at the halfway mark.
										
										The duo brought up the 100-run stand off 70 balls but the boundaries weren't flowing as they went boundary-less for 18 balls. Kohli finally broke the shackles and thumped one wide of long off for a four off Arshdeep to bring up his fifty off 40 balls. He then cracked a six over wide long off, off Nathan Ellis.
										
										Curran bowled an excellent 16th over and could have had the wicket of du Plessis but keeper Jitesh Sharma dropped a tough high catch off a top edge but he made amends in the next over as he plucked a splendid catch diving to his left, off Harpreet Brar, to dismiss Virat Kohli for 59(47).
										
										Brar struck a huge blow off the next ball as he had Maxwell caught at point trying to go for a big one but miscuing it completely. Faf du Plessis then tried to inject the momentum with a couple of sixes but Nathan Ellis bounced back hard after being hit for a six off the previous ball to have the RCB opener caught at long off for 84 (56), off a smart slower delivery.

<h2>RCB VS LSG</h2><b>
	RCB bounced back hard, after the defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders, to beat Lucknow Super Giants in Match 43 of TATA IPL 2023 at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.

	The away team Produced a magnificent bowling and fielding performance as they defended 126 runs in an electric performance in Lucknow. Faf du Plessis' 44 off 40 and Virat Kohli's 31 off 30 had helped RCB post 126/9. A collective bowling performance then saw the bowlers bowl with discipline and pick up regular wickets, ably supported by the fielders who pulled off brilliant catches, stumping and run outs, to bowl LSG out for 108 and win by 18 runs.
	
	Chasing 127, Lucknow Super Giants were rocked early as they lost Kyle Mayers early. The LSG opener mistimed his heave to mid on where Suyash Prabhudessai made no mistake. Josh Hazlewood then bowled a fantastic second over which saw Impact Player Ayush play and miss multiple times. He gave away just one but Krunal Pandya released the pressure in style in the next over, cracking three consecutive fours off Siraj to make it 16 off the third over. Krunal though couldn't continue for long as he chipped one straight into the hands of Virat Kohli at long off to give Glenn Maxwell a wicket in his first over.
	
	Hazlewood struck in his next over, having Badoni (4 off 11) caught at short extra cover as Kohli pulled off a very good reflex catch to reduce LSG to 21/3.
	
	Wanindu Hasarange made it three wickets in three overs for RCB as he had Deepak Hooda stumped with Karthik showing good presence of mind. Nichoolas Pooran got off the mark with a huge six first ball but it was RCB's Powerplay all the way as LSG hobbled to 34/4 at the end of first six overs.
	
	Karn Sharma joined the wicket taking party, having Pooran (9 off 7) caught at deep square leg off a mistimed slog sweep as LSG lost half their side inside seven overs.
	
	K Gowtham then provided a bit of relief, cracking a six and a four off Karn Sharma with LSG bringing up the fifty in the 9th over. Gowtham hit another six in the next over, lofting one straight down the ground off Hasaranga to reach 63/5 at the halfway mark. RCB introduced Harshal Patel as their Impact Player, replacing Anuj Rawat, at the start of the 11th over. LSG were then dealt with a huge blow as Stoinis (13 off 19) mistimed his loft to long off, off Karn Sharma and departed and three balls later Gowtham (23 off 13) too walked back to the hut, run out, trying to complete a second run. Three overs later, LSG suffered another run out as Bishoni(5 off 10) was caught well short on the second run. As the wickets kept falling the required rate kept climbing.
	
	LSG went six overs without a boundary before Mishra got an outside edge to third man for a streaky four in the 17th over and Naveen-ul-Haq thumped one over extra cover another four in the next over to bring the equation to 31 needed off 12 balls.
	
	Naveen got another four in the next over, off an inside edge wide of the short fine leg, trying to go for a reverse scoop but he departed next ball, caught behind off Hazlewood. The injured KL Rahul walked out to bat with 24 needed off 8 but he couldn't pull off the heist as RCB bowled LSG out for 108 with Harshal taking the final wicket of Amit Mishra.
	
	Earlier, Faf du Plessis, who was back leading the Royal Challengers Bangalore side, won the toss and elected to bat. They made four changes to the starting XI as Faf du Plessis, Josh Hazlewood, Anuj Rawat and Karn Sharma replaced Shahbaz Ahmed, David Willey, Harshal Patel and Vijaykumar Vyshak. They named Harshal Patel, Sonu Yadav, Michael Bracewell, Vijaykumar Vyshak and Shahbaz Ahmed as their substitutes.
	
	Lucknow Super Giants made two changes to the starting eleven as K Gowtham and Amit Mishra replaced Ayush Badoni and Avesh Khan. They named Ayush Badoni, Daniel Sams, Quinton de Kock, Prerak Mankad and Avesh Khan as their substitutes.
	
	Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis got RCB off to a steady start but the Lucknow Super Giants made sure they kept the boundary count in check as they conceded just three fours and a six in the Powerplay. RCB reached 42/0 at the end of the first six overs. It was a mixed phase for both the teams but LSG were dealt with a blow as KL Rahul had to leave the field because of a leg injury suffered while trying to save a four in the second over.
	
	Things further slowed down as RCB went boundary-less for the next three overs. Kohli finally broke the shackles to hit a beautiful cover drive for four off Yash Thakur for a boundary after 23 balls. LSG reaped the rewards of building the pressure as Ravi Bishnoi had Kohli (31 off 30) stumped trying to charge down the track but missing his swing. The next two overs brought just nine runs and then another batter walked back trying to up the scoring as Anuj Rawat (9 off 11) pulled one straight into the hands of the deep mid-wicket fielder.
	
	Bishnoi struck another crucial blow in the next over as he trapped Glenn Maxwell (4 off 5) LBW after the RCB batter missed his reverse sweep. Maxwell reviewed it but the ball tracking showed it was clipping the top of stumps. The umpire's call stayed as Maxwell walked back.
	
	Two overs later, another RCB batter walked back to the hut as Amit Mishra had Suyash Prabhudessai (6 off 7) caught at long off by K Gowtham. The fielder misjudged it at first but made a good adjustment to dive forward and pouch it inches above the ground. Rain then interrupted play before Karthik upped the ante with a four and a six off Naveen-ul-Haq and Amit Mishra respectively post the resumption. Mishra struck back in the same over as he made Du Plessis (44 off 40), who had held fort at one end, miscue one off a slog sweep and Krunal Pandya grabbed a fantastic catch. Naveen then trapped Mahipal Lomror (3 off 3) LBW as wickets kept tumbling for RCB. Yash Thakur then produced another moment of brilliance in the field as he ran out Karthik off his own bowling via a brilliant reflex fielding effort and knocking down the stumps at the non-striker's end.
