                          <h2>MATCH REPORT:  KXIP V DC</h2><b>
							Delhi Capitals dealt a hammer blow to Punjab Kings' chances of qualifying for the Play-offs as they beat the hosts by 15 runs in Match 64 of TATA IPL 2023 at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala.

							A commanding batting performance led by Rilee Rossouw (82* off 37) helped the away side post a daunting 213/2 after the openers David Warner (46 off 31) and comeback man Prithvi Shaw (54 off 38) had added 94 for the opening wicket. A collective bowling effort then saw the DC bowlers survive Livingstone(94 off 48) scare as they restricted PBKS to 198/8 and won the match by 15 runs.
							
							Chasing 214, Punjab Kings stuttered at the start as they lost captain Shikhar Dhawan early. Khaleel Ahmed bowled a fantastic first over for a maiden and then Ishan Sharma struck with his first ball, having Dhawan caught at slip in the second over. Prabhsimran Singh then took the aggressive route as he combined power with placement to hit four fours, including three back to back fours off Ishant Sharma. Atharva Taide took the attack to Anich Nortje in the next over, cracking a four and a six and then hitting a four and a six off Mukesh Kumar but PBKS got lucky off the last ball of the over as the keeper missed a run out with Prabhsimran set off for a bye but was sent back by Taide. A direct hit would have been curtains for the PBKS opener. The home side reached 47/1 at the end of the Powerplay.
							
							Axar Patel came into the attack and struck straightaway to provide the breakthrough as he had Prabhsimran (22 off 19) caught at wide long on. DC could have had a couple more but Nortje dropped Liam Livingstone and Yash Dhull dropped Atharva Taide in one Kuldeep Yadav over. Livingstone rubbed salt into the wounds cracking a huge six off the penultimate ball of the over as PBKS reached 75/2 at the halfway stage. Luck continued to favour PBKS as Livingstone and Taide survived run outs off the same ball trying to run through for a risky single and then an overthrow. Taide and Livingstone were living dangerously as a couple of mistimed shots fell short of the fieders. The duo hit 15 runs off Axar and 12 runs off Nortje as Taide brought up his fifty off 38 balls. Kuldeep then bowled a tight over, conceding just five off the over.
							
							The required run rate creeped over 16 and then Livingstone cracked a couple of fours off Mukesh Kumar before a tactical move saw PBKS retire out Atharva Taide in the 15th over which brought in Jitesh Sharma. He didn't last long though as he departed without opening his account. The new batter Shahrukh Khan opened his account with a six first ball to bring the equation to 79 needed off 24. Livingstone then switched on the fifth gear as hit a four off a no ball from Khaleel to bring up his fifty off 30 balls and then smashed a massive six straight down the ground off the Free Hit. Khaleel though bounced back to have Shahrukh Khan caught at long on. Livingstone smacked another six as PBKS amassed 20 off the over.
							
							With 59 needed off 18, Livingstone and Curran hammered three sixes off Mukesh Kumar to bring the equation down to 38 off 22. Curran cracked a four off the first ball of the penultimate over from Nortje but the South African pacer hit back hard to knock down his leg stump off the next ball. PBKS lost two in two as Harpreet Brar was run out at the bowler's end, scampering through for a bye to get Livingstone on strike. Nortje bowled a brilliant over, giving away just five. With 33 needed off the last over, Ishant started off with a dot. But it all got nervous for the DC camp as Livingstone smacked a six over long on and thumped a four over covers. Ishant then bowled a waist high no ball which Livinstone smashed over extra cover for another six as the equation came down to 16 off 3. Livingstone then missed his swing off a full toss as DC heaved a sigh of relief. The England batter mistimed the next one over cover and didn't run. He smashed the last ball straight into the hands of the long off fielder as DC won the match by 15 runs.
							
							Earlier, Punjab Kings captain Shikhar Dhawan won the toss and elected to bowl. They made three changes to the starting XI as Atharva Taide, Nathan Ellis and Kagiso Rabada replaced Prabhsimran Singh, Sikandar Raza and Rishi Dhawan. They named Prabhsimran Singh, Sikandar Raza, Matthew Short, Rishi Dhawan and Mohit Rathee as their substitutes.
							
							Delhi Capitals too made three changes to the starting eleven as Prithvi Shaw, Yash Dhull and Anrich Nortje replaced Mukesh Kumar, Pravin Dubey and Mitchell Marsh. Mukesh Kumar, Abishek Porel, Ripal Pate, Pravin Dubey and Sarfaraz Khan made it to the away side's substitutes list.
							
							The Punjab Kings bowlers started off well as Kagiso Rabad bowled a fiery second over which had the batters hopping. The home side didn't concede a four in the first two overs. David Warner then finally provided some impetus as he thumped one over cover-point and pulled the next one off a top-edge to fine leg for back to back fours off Sam Curran in the third over. Shaw then got his first four as he smacked a short one over point for a four off Rabada. Warner then flicked one over deep square leg for an effortless six and then combined power two balls later to smack a pull over deep mid-wicket for the second six in the over as the away side amassed 17 off the over. Shaw welcomed Arshdeep Singh into the attack with two fours and a six to take DC past fifty in the fifth over.

                                       <h2>PBSK VS GT</h2><b>
										The Gujarat Titans (GT) were back to winning ways in the TATA Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 with a 6-wicket victory over the Punjab Kings (PBKS) on Thursday at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali.An impressive Mohit Sharma debut, an elegant Shubman Gill half-century and a Trademark Tewatia finish powered GT to a final-over win. Chasing a target of 154 on an excellent batting track, Gujarat Titans were off to a rollicking start. The pure elegance of Shubman Gill and fearless intent of Wriddhiman Saha put GT ahead in the chase that started with a flurry of fours. Just when the GT openers were nearing the fifty-run partnership, Kagiso Rabada came to PBKS’ rescue by claiming his 100th IPL wicket and dismissing the dangerous Saha. Young Sai Sudharsan joined forces with Shubman Gill as the duo maintained the momentum of the chase with nonchalant strokes. GT reached 80/1 at the halfway mark. PBKS bounced back with two quick wickets after Arshdeep Singh and Harpreet Brar dismissed Sai Sudharsan and GT skipper Hardik Pandya respectively. Gill continued his splendid batting display and reached his half-century with a four as he was joined by David Miller at the crease. With 7 needed off the final over, Sam Curran cleaned up set batter Shubman Gill to snatch back momentum. However, ice-cool Rahul Tewatia scooped Curran to hit the winning runs and seal the deal for GT. Earlier, Gujarat Titans’ captain Hardik Pandya, who was back to lead the side, won the toss and opted to field first. Mohd. Shami jumped into the action straightaway and found early success after Prabhsimran Singh was caught inside the circle on the second ball.Matthew Short joined skipper Shikhar Dhawan.

<h2>PBSK VS MI </h2><b>
	Mumbai Indians made it two wins in a row as they beat Punjab Kings in Match 46 of TATA IPL 2023 at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali.

	MI put on a chasing masterclass as Ishan Kishan (75 off 41) and Impact Player Suryakumar Yadav's (66 off 31) blistering knocks helped the away side chase down 215 after Liam Livingstone (82* off 42) and Jitesh Sharma's (49* off 27) aggressive knocks had powered PBKS to 214/3 in the first innings.
	
	Tilak Varma(26* off 10) and Tim David (19* off 10) provided the finishing touches to power MI to a thumping six-wicket win.
	
	Chasing 215, Mumbai Indians were jolted early as they lost Rohit Sharma off just the third ball of the innings as he sliced one uppishly to deep point off Rishi Dhawan.
	
	Ishan Kishan and Cameron Green then went on the counter attack as they hit a flurry of fours. Kishan went after Rishi Dhawan in the fifth over and hit him for a couple of sixes into the stands before Green ended the over with a four to make it 17 off the over.
	
	It was Impact Player Nathan Ellis, who created an immediate impact to break the 54-run stand as he had Green (23 off 18) caught at deep mid-wicket off a slower one as MI reached 54/2 at the end of the Powerplay.
	
	MI's Impact Player, Suryakumar Yadav, then strode out to bat at No.3 (He replaced debutant Akash Madhwal).
	
	After a couple of quiet overs, Kishan released the pressure valve smacking a six and a four off Harpreet Brar. The duo went after Chahar in the next over, cracking three fours to make it 27 from two over. Kishan brought up his fifty off 29 balls. Suryakumar Yadav then took the attack to Curran hitting a couple of sublime sixes over the off side before thumping one down the ground for a four off the next ball. He brought up his fifty off 23 balls with his quintessential pick-up flick to fine leg for four as MI accumulated 23 runs off the Curran over.
	
	Suryakumar Yadav brought up the 100-run stand with Kishan, off just 52 balls as he flicked one over mid-wicket for a four off Arshdeep. Kishan went after Arshdeep in the same over, smashing two fours and a six to make it 21 off the over. PBKS needed a wicket desperately and Impact Player Ellis provided the impact moment to send back Impact Player Suryakumar Yadav (66 off 31) as Arshdeep pulled off a very good leaping catch at short third man. With 37 needed off 24, Arshdeep bounced back hard, after being hit for 21 in the previous over, to have Kishan (75 off 41) caught at fine leg. Tilak Varma though got going straight away as he got off the mark with a thumping six over deep mid-wicket, then paddled one for a four and then swung one over deep square leg for another six to turn tables and bring the equation down to 21 off 18. Tim David and Tilak Varma took 9 off the Curran over as the equation read 12 needed off 12.
	
	David Sliced the first ball of the penultimate over from Arshdeep over third man for a four and with five needed off 8, Tilak Varma finished it off in style with a massive six over long off to win it for the away side. David remained unbeaten on 19 (10) while Varma remained not out on 26(10).
	
	Earlier, Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bowl. They made two changes to the starting XI as Nehal Wadhera and debutant Akash Madhwal replaced Suryakumar Yadav and Riley Meredith. They named Suryakumar Yadav, Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Vishnu Vinod and Ramaneep Singh as their substitutes.
	
	Punjab Kings made three changes to the starting eleven as Prabhsimran Singh, Matthew Short and Rishi Dhawan replaced Atharva Taide, Kagiso Rabada and Sikandar Raza. Sikandar Raza, Nathan Ellis, Atharva Taide, Mohit Rathee and Shivam Singh made it to the home side's substitutes list.
	
	Mumbai Indians got off to a good start as Arshad Khan removed Prabhsimran Singh (9 off 7) early, in the second over, caught behind. Shikhar Dhawan and Prabhsimran Singh had hit a well-timed four each to get into the groove but Prabhsimran didn't last long as he edged one to the keeper while looking to slash at one outside off.
	
	Shikhar Dhawan and Matthew Short then steadied the ship with a mix of attack and defence as Short smacked a four and a six off Arshad before Dhawan welcomed Chawla into the attack with two consecutive fours to take PBKS to 50/1 at the end of the Powerplay. Dhawan then got a reprieve in the next over as Jofra Archer put down a touch chance at backward point. Dhawan's luck didn't last long as he was stumped in the next over, off Chawla. It was a fantastic battle brewing as Dhawan charged down the track first ball and smacked a four straight down the ground. Chawla hit back hard as he saw Dhawan charging again and dragged his length short to outfox Dhawan (30 off 20 balls) and have him stumped via a googly. The next two overs went for just 13 as PBKS reached 78/2 at the halfway mark.
